- Write the HTML needed to create the layout—refer to what the CSS is doing and use that to figure out the proper HTML tags.

- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Optional challenges

*These challenges are here if you’d like to try a little more work—they are for extra experience and learning. They are completely optional and not graded. Show them to me if you’d like—I’d love to see them.*

1. Make each item into a link.
2. Add hover styles to each link that are slightly different—each should hover with a different colour.

*(You are allowed to edit the CSS to complete the optional challenges.)*
